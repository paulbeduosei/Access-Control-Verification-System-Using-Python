# Access-Control-Verification-System-Using-Python
In this project, I developed a Python program that simulates a basic access control system. The program uses predefined lists of approved users and their assigned devices to verify login attempts. It first checks if the provided username exists in the approved users list. If the user is authorized, the program retrieves the corresponding device ID and compares it with the one provided during login. Based on these conditions, the program displays appropriate messages indicating whether the user is approved, whether the device is correctly assigned, or if access should be denied. This approach demonstrates the use of conditional statements, indexing, and logical decision-making in Python to create a simple yet effective security check system.
This project highlights how fundamental programming concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios such as access control and authentication. By combining conditional logic with list operations, the program successfully simulates a two-step verification process, ensuring that both user identity and device authorization are validated. The exercise strengthened my understanding of Python’s decision-making structures and demonstrated how they can be used to enhance security and system reliability.
